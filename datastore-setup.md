# ðŸ“¦ Datastore Setup

## âœ… Chosen Datastore: MongoDB

## ðŸ’¡ Why MongoDB?
MongoDB was selected due to its flexibility and ease of use for handling unstructured and evolving datasets. Key reasons include:

- **Schema-less Structure**: Ideal for storing mock data without rigid schemas.
- **Ease of Integration**: Works seamlessly with Python and Streamlit.
- **Cloud Hosted (Atlas)**: Easily deployable, managed, and accessible with minimal setup.
- **Document-Oriented**: Each temperature record can be stored as a document, enabling fast read/write operations.

This makes MongoDB a great choice for simulating real-time updates with randomly generated weather data.
